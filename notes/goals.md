# Goals

- functional, immutable, no side effects
- just string manipulation
- static typing, type inference
- simple language, few primitives
- faster and simpler than go


## Anti features

- No garbage collection.
- No destructors.
- No exceptions (and no surprise control flow).
- No implicit function calls.
- No implicit type conversions.
- No subtyping.
- No macros.
- No reflection.
- No uninitialized variables.
- No first-class async.
- No function overloading.
- No arithmetic precedence.
- No variable shadowing.


## Features

- typing is optional everywhere
  - can use lints to enforce more strict typing
  - libraries should annotate top-level functions
  - fast to prototype
